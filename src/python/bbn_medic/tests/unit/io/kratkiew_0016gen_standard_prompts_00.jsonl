In general, they were tested extensively in humans, animals and in lab studies and found no evidence that the drug caused birth defects.\r\rExamples of Category-A medications include antihistamines such as lorazepam, prenatal vitamins, acetaminophen (\\*check for safe dose), anti-inflammatories, calcium channel blockers for hypertension, folic acid and potassium chloride for heart rhythm regulation.\r\r- Category B: Some studies do suggest that this may cause a slight increased risk to the fetus compared with women who don\u2019t use the medication. However, those risks may be very low \u2013 probably less than 5% - and pregnancy may still be continued despite potential problems being present.\r\rExamples of medications classified as Category-B include aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, many antibiotics, clonidine for high blood pressure, hydrochlorthiazide, iron tablets (as long as free iron has been shown not to cause damage) and magnesium citrate for osteoporosis prevention.\r\r- Category C: Pregnant females exposed to these medications could experience birth effects that haven\u2019t yet been adequately studied.

Acetaminophen works by reducing inflammation and decreasing fever. It may also relieve headaches and muscle tension. The maximum recommended dose for an adult is up to 4000MG at one time; however, it varies among individuals, so always check with your doctor before taking acetaminophen to ensure it's safe for you and avoid overdose.\r\rIt's essential to be aware that some medications that may be fine to take in general daily life can pose risks to developing fetus or newborn babies, making them unsafe to use during pregnancy and nursing time. Therefore, it's always best to avoid or limit such medications as much as possible and seek guidance from a qualified healthcare professional who has a thorough understanding of your individual situation.\r\rRegarding dietary supplements and vitamins, pregnant women typically require higher levels of several nutrients, including folic acid, iron, calcium, magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D.
